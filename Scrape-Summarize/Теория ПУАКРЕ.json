    "shortly": "Grigori Perelman is a Russian mathematician known for proving the Poincaré conjecture, a century-old problem, making it the only solved problem among the seven Millennium Prize Problems.",
    "more": "Born on June 13, 1966, in Leningrad to a Jewish family, Perelman exhibited exceptional mathematical talent from a young age. He won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1982 and later completed his studies at Leningrad State University with honors. After working in various institutions and returning to Russia, he developed original methods to prove the Poincaré conjecture between 2002 and 2003. His work was verified by multiple independent groups of mathematicians. Despite receiving numerous prestigious awards, including the Fields Medal and the Clay Millennium Prize, he declined them due to disagreements with the mathematical community.",
