    "summary": "1. SHORTLY: Grigori Perelman is a renowned Russian mathematician known for proving the Poincaré conjecture, a significant problem in topology that remained unsolved for nearly a century. He has declined multiple prestigious awards, including the Fields Medal and a $1 million Millennium Prize, citing disagreements with the mathematical community.\n\n2. MORE: Born on June 13, 1966, in Leningrad to Jewish parents, Perelman demonstrated exceptional mathematical talent from an early age. He won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1982 and later completed his PhD in mathematics. After proving the Poincaré conjecture through innovative methods involving Ricci flow, he withdrew from professional mathematics, expressing disillusionment with ethical standards in the field. Despite his groundbreaking work being recognized as a major scientific breakthrough, he chose to live in seclusion and rejected various accolades.\n\n3. IMPORTANT:\n   - Perelman proved the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture between 2002 and 2003.\n   - He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2006 but declined it.\n   - In March 2010, he was announced as the recipient of the first Clay Millennium Prize for solving a millennium problem but rejected it.\n   - His work led to international acclaim and recognition as \"Breakthrough of the Year\" by Science magazine in December 2006.\n   - Perelman's contributions include proving the soul conjecture in differential geometry and establishing modern foundations for Alexandrov spaces.\n\n4. RELATED:\n   - What are other significant contributions made by Grigori Perelman aside from the Poincaré conjecture?\n   - How did Richard S. Hamilton's work influence Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture?\n   - What controversies surrounded Perelman's rejection of prestigious awards?\n   - Can ethical concerns impact a scientist’s career trajectory as seen in Perelman's case?\n   - How has Grigori Perelman's life changed since gaining worldwide recognition?"
