    "shortly": "The Hippocratic Oath is a pledge that embodies the fundamental moral and ethical principles guiding physicians' behavior, with historical roots dating back to ancient Egypt and significant variations across cultures.",
    "more": "Historically, oaths similar to the Hippocratic Oath have existed since ancient times and were first documented by Hippocrates in Hellenistic Alexandria. The original oath prohibited practices such as abortion and euthanasia, reflecting the moral standards of its time. Over centuries, the text has undergone numerous translations and revisions, leading to modern interpretations that align more closely with contemporary medical ethics. Various countries have adapted their versions of the oath, such as the Soviet Union's physician oath established in 1971 and different pledges used in Israel and the United States today.",
    "important": [
        "The Hippocratic Oath originated from ancient traditions predating Hippocrates, possibly linked to Asclepius's descendants.",
        "The original version explicitly forbade physicians from performing abortions and assisting in euthanasia.",
        "In North America and Europe, the traditional text was replaced with a 'professional code' around 2006 due to evolving medical ethics.",
        "Modern interpretations often omit prohibitions on abortions and euthanasia that were present in earlier versions of the oath.",
        "The current Russian physician's oath is legislatively established under federal law regarding health care fundamentals."
